# Piano-on-Arduino
As first install Arduino IDE on your PC to upload your code on Arduino.
After that connect your Arduino and open the code choose your port and your Arduino.
I didn't used any libraries, so you don't need to install them.

Wait until the code will be uploaded, and Your piano is ready to work)
